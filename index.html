  <h2 class="section-title">About Us</h2>
  <p class="tagline">Veteran-Owned. Family-Focused. Built for Safety, Driven by Purpose.</p>
  <p>
    Z&D Airsoft, LLC is a mobile airsoft and Nerf experience based in Findlay, Ohio, designed to deliver high-energy fun with an unwavering commitment to safety, responsibility, and community values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Founded by (Fmr.) U.S. Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Mark Ellis, Z&D Airsoft was born from a passion for structured, purpose-driven training environments‚Äîcombined with a love for family-friendly entertainment. Mark brings over 10 years of active duty service, including deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as Marine Corps-level Rifle and Pistol Expert Marksmanship credentials.
  </p>
  <p>
    His experience leading Marines and serving as a Coordinator for Toys for Tots inspired him to build something unique: a safe environment that teaches responsibility, while also demonstrating community responsibility through our commitment to donate locally, ensuring we make an impact on our neighbors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our trailer comes equipped with tethered airsoft and Nerf blasters, smart targets, and a safety-focused team. From birthdays to fairs, we bring the mission to you‚Äîno power needed.
  </p>
  <h3 class="highlight-title">Our Core Principles</h3>
