  <h2 class="section-title">About Us</h2>
  <p class="tagline">Veteran-Owned. Family-Focused. Built for Safety, Driven by Purpose.</p>
  <p>
    Z&D Airsoft, LLC is a mobile airsoft and Nerf experience based in Findlay, Ohio, designed to deliver high-energy fun with an unwavering commitment to safety, responsibility, and community values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Founded by (Fmr.) U.S. Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Mark Ellis, Z&D Airsoft was born from a passion for structured, purpose-driven training environments—combined with a love for family-friendly entertainment. Mark brings over 10 years of active duty service, including deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as Marine Corps-level Rifle and Pistol Expert Marksmanship credentials.
  </p>
  <p>
    His experience leading Marines and serving as a Coordinator for Toys for Tots inspired him to build something unique: a safe environment that teaches responsibility, while also demonstrating community responsibility through our commitment to donate locally, ensuring we make an impact on our neighbors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our trailer comes equipped with tethered airsoft and Nerf blasters, smart targets, and a safety-focused team. From birthdays to fairs, we bring the mission to you—no power needed.
  </p>
  <h3 class="highlight-title">Our Core Principles</h3>
  <ul class="about-list">
    <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Mandatory safety briefings, eye protection, and no PvP combat.</li>
    <li><strong>All Ages Welcome:</strong> Nerf (6+), Airsoft (8+, under 13 require parental supervision), sessions alternate for comfort.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Driven:</strong> 10% of our gross profits go to a local charity every quarter.</li>
    <li><strong>Veteran-Led:</strong> Professionalism, structure, and leadership in every event.</li>
  </ul>
