  <h2 class="section-title">Giving Back: Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    At Z&D Airsoft, we believe in more than just tactical fun — we believe in purpose. Each quarter, 10% of our gross profits are donated to charities making a difference in our community. From veterans’ services to youth programs, we’re proud to stand behind causes that align with our core values of leadership, responsibility, and service.
