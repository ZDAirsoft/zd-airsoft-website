  <h3 class="highlight-title">âœ… Our Quality Commitment</h3>
  <p>We stand behind every shirt we print. If you ever have concerns about:</p>
  <ul class="about-list">
    <li>Print quality</li>
    <li>Logo placement</li>
    <li>Peeling or durability</li>

  <p>Let us know. Weâ€™re committed to finding a solutionâ€”whether that means a direct replacement or a discount on a future purchase. Thereâ€™s no strict time limit, as long as the shirt hasnâ€™t been worn or washed.</p>
  <p>For shirts that arrive damaged, we offer a 100% refund or replacement if reported within 7 days of delivery. This policy helps us manage conditions outside our control after deliveryâ€”but weâ€™ll always do our best to make it right, even beyond that window.</p>
